# Remove Pronouns in Foundry VTT

Removes gender ideology from your games. :)

- In User Configuration, removes the Pronouns section.
- In Pathfinder 2E, replaces "Gender/Pronouns" on the character sheet with a more appropriate term.

## Installation

1. In your Foundry VTT, go to `Setup -> Modules -> Install Module`
2. In the `Manifest URL` textbox paste:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Martenfur/foundry-vtt-remove-pronouns/refs/heads/master/module.json
```
3. Enable the `Remove Pronouns` module in your world.

## Compatibility

Tested on Foundry 13, but should work with future and probably past releases too.

## Contributing

If you find any other instances of forced pronouns or other weird stuff, feel free to create an issue.
